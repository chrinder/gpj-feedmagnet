Overview
--------

These examples demonstrate ways that the FeedMagnet JavaScript SDK can be used to power custom implementations.

Note that you must have a FeedMagnet account and server to set up the content feeds that are being pulled in. We use the `my.feedmagnet.com` server in most of these examples, but the content on that server is purely for testing and demonstration purposes and could be edited or removed at any time.

If you are interested in setting up a FeedMagnet account, contact us at [FeedMagnet.com](http://www.feedmagnet.com).


Full Documentation

The full documentation for the FeedMagnet SDK is available when logged in to your FeedMagnet server. The link is in the footer.
